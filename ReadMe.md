This repository is helpful in interfacing LM35 to the Bolt Wifi module, using an Arduino.
The method differs from directly interfacing the LM35 with the Bolt Wifi module, that you can send data in the form of Degrees Celcius or Degress Fereinhight.

Ensure to download and install the BoltIoT-Arduino-Helpler library by Inventrom. The link is below
